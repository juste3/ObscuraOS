# 🗺️ ObscuraOS Development Roadmap

Welcome to the master plan for building **ObscuraOS** — a mysterious, custom OS built from scratch, with style, control, and chaos in perfect harmony.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Bootloader & Kernel Setup
> **Status:** ✅ In Progress

- [x] Write `boot.asm` (Bootloader in NASM)
- [x] Load 2nd-stage kernel from disk
- [x] Setup a Makefile to automate builds
- [x] Create `.img` with `dd`
- [x] Boot it in QEMU
- [ ] Clean output and error logs

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Screen & Input
> **Status:** 🛠️ Starting

- [x] Set video mode / print to screen
- [ ] Display welcome message / splash screen
- [ ] Add keyboard input (scancode handling)
- [ ] Add mouse input (PS/2)
- [ ] Create a simple cursor on screen

---

## 📁 Phase 3 – File System + CLI
> **Status:** 🔒 Not started

- [ ] Create a virtual file system (VFS)
- [ ] Design a simple shell/terminal
- [ ] Implement basic commands (`ls`, `cat`, `clear`, etc.)
- [ ] Read/write from disk
- [ ] Display directory structure

---

## 🧠 Phase 4 – Multitasking & Memory
> **Status:** 🔒 Not started

- [ ] Set up paging & virtual memory
- [ ] Implement a basic scheduler
- [ ] Support for running 2–5 processes
- [ ] Simple memory manager (malloc/free)

---

## 🎨 Phase 5 – Graphical Interface (GUI)
> **Status:** 🧪 Dream phase

- [ ] Draw desktop environment
- [ ] Taskbar with time and launcher
- [ ] Clickable icons & app launching
- [ ] Themes / customization system
- [ ] Sound support (optional)

---

## 🛠️ Phase 6 – Tools & Ecosystem
> **Status:** 🧠 Future genius plans

- [ ] Build a custom IDE for ObscuraOS
- [ ] Design your own package manager
- [ ] Add a web browser (text-based or minimal GUI)
- [ ] Add networking (TCP/IP stack)

---

## 🚀 Bonus Goals (for later)
- [ ] Port a game or emulator
- [ ] Write documentation in the OS
- [ ] Make an installer (USB bootable)
- [ ] Write a basic compiler for a custom scripting language

---

## 🔥 Final Vision
> ObscuraOS isn't just an operating system.  
> It's a **statement**. A fully handcrafted system built from nothing but bits, bytes, and madness.
