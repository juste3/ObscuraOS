# ObscuraOS 🕶️

**ObscuraOS** is a solo-developed operating system written from scratch in Assembly.  
It aims to be minimal, mysterious, and powerful — built with passion, precision, and the spirit of full control over the machine.

## 🧠 Vision
To build an operating system that teaches me how computers work from the ground up — BIOS, bootloaders, drivers, UI, and everything in between.

## 🚀 Features (so far)
- Custom bootloader (prints "Hello World")
- Runs on QEMU as a 16-bit real-mode OS
- NASM + Makefile setup
- Floppy image generation for testing

## 📅 Dev Log
Logs are available in the `/logs/` folder, updated daily:
- Day 1: Bootloader & screen output
- Day 2: Reading from the disk (upcoming)
- Future: Mouse support, file system, shell, window managment, customizable GUI and much more...
